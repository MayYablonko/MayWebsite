    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm May, 23 years old, from Jaffa.</p>
        <p>I embarked on my coding adventure during my university degree (B.Sc. in Biology & Psychology), where I took an Introductory Python Courseâ€”and I've been in love with coding ever since!</p>
        <p>Since then, I've been self-studying C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.</p>
        <p>Join me on this adventure, and witness how I evolve into the best developer ever, all while tough-typing with long nails, and making leopard print look professional :)</p>

    <p>Contact me <a href=".\contact.html">here</a>.</p>
